## SideNotes

#### Inverse Data Flow
React operates from top to bottom/biggest to smallest - passing data from the parent container (state) to the children container (props).

#### VirtualDOM 
JS representation of the actual DOM- acts as a staging area for changes to be tested before the actual implementation.
