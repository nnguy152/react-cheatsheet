# Components

React is composed of component-based separation of concerns. 
Components are functional elements that take in data to produce a dynamic UI using JSX, 
a language that uses JS functions to return HTML elements.

There are two types of comoenents:
  - Presentational: Functional components that render data (does not have state) and can accept props.
  - Container: Class components that can contain presentational components and can take in data  (has state, which allows components to be reusable and encapsulated). Usually has a constructor to assign state.
