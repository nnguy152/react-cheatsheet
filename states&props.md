# State & Props

States and props are how data is passed around and managed within a React app. User interactions/input churns out UI that rerenders with that new state.

  - _State_: Are local/native to the component and mutable (can be changed withinn the component).
  - _Props_: Are passed into a component from a parent component and immutable from within a component.

### Instance Property
this.state = { property: '', other property }
